# Motivation

--
<!-- I started this project because I felt that starting learning Unity was at first like learning any other language. First you learn the syntax and start creating basic apps but then you get better at developing when you learn the tools for that language and how to improve your work with them. I think this is the same, because when I learned Unity for the first time you needed to code a lot of basic tools that could greatly improve the time you spend making your game or app instead of reinventing the wheel. -->

# Considerations

There is always a posibility that this repository becomes outdated, mostly because new packages from the asset store and repositories appear in the future. This is because of the nature of technlogy and this can be avoided, so in order to keep this project as updated as possible with what other users know, please create a new issue to include or remove what you think is necessary.

Another point is the categorization of the resources provided here. Since some of them can be included in different categories at the same time a cross reference will be created in the form of a hastag to notify you (the visitor) that maybe you need to look in a different place of this repository or in other external site to find more info.

I hope all of you find this helpful. Let's go with the contents.

Please see [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/RyanNielson/awesome-unity/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

Thanks to all the [contributors](https://github.com/agarcialeon/awesome-unity/graphs/contributors), this wouldn't be possible without you! 

# To be done

:exclamation: NOTE: Without any order of preference.

* Add repository logo (WIP).
* Add tags for free and paid assets. This can be a reason to use or not a resource due to budget in development so even if a package is paid maybe it's that there isn't any other package that provides the same functionality or that the package authors provide a great work and they should be paid for their effort.
* Use tags to classify a resource instead of using a category. For example, a package for virtual reality can be a plugin or a library.
* Create more categories for specific resources that don't combine well.
* Add best practices for Unity development in corresponding section.
* Starter kit section with all the things needed or recommended for beginners.
* Include resources for recommended asset store packages (well tested, most voted and so on).
* Fill up FAQ section.
* Fill up section for contributors.
* Fill up people to follow.
* Fill up communities section.
* Include twitter tricks shared by users.
* Mark deprecated packages.
* Change introduction at the beginning ot the readme file to indicate better the visitors how its organized.
* Add pending starred repositories.
* Do shortcut png image with unity editor shortcuts.
* Fix table of contents links.
* Snippets & Gists

And many more...
